## Recommendations
1. **Working Servers (3/7):** Memory, Filesystem, and Context7 servers are fully functional
2. **Authentication Issues (3/7):** Brave Search, Supabase, and Xero require API tokens/credentials
3. **Dependency Issues (1/7):** Puppeteer needs system libraries installed

To fix authentication issues:
- Configure environment variables for API tokens
- Set up OAuth for services that require it
- Install missing system dependencies for Puppeteer
